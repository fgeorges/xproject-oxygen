This project provides a plugin for the [oXygen XML](http://oxygenxml.com/) IDE,
to support [XProject](http://expath.org/xproject), the XML project manager from
[EXPath](http://expath.org/).

To install it, unzip the release file in your oXygen plugins directory (the
sub-directory named `plugins` in your main oXygen installation dir) in a new
subdir called `xproject`.

FYI this plugin dir will contain:

- `plugin.xml` (from `xproject-plugin/rsrc/plugin.xml`)
- `xproject-oxygen-plugin.jar` (from `xproject-plugin/dist/xproject-oxygen-plugin.jar`)
- `repo/` (from `xproject-plugin/rsrc/repo/`)
- `lib/` (from `xproject-plugin/lib/`)
